An integrated system for managing employees, payroll, attendance, and recruitment processes.

 **Mixed Domains HR Management System (HRMS)**
A Mixed Domains HR Management System is an integrated, centralized software platform designed to streamline and automate the diverse and interconnected functions of a Human Resources department. Unlike systems that focus on a single area (like just payroll or just recruitment), a mixed-domain system unifies all core HR processes into a single, cohesive ecosystem.

The primary goal is to eliminate data silos, reduce administrative burden, ensure compliance, and provide a seamless experience for both HR professionals and employees. By managing everything from hiring to retirement under one roof, organizations can gain powerful insights, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
